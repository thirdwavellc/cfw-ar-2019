            englewood women's initiative
        </h1>
        <p>The challenges facing Englewood are significant. Decades of neglect and divestment have produced violence, isolation and barriers to opportunity. Fourty percent of residents live with economic insecurity; 62 percent of renters are housing insecure.</p>
        <p>We believe that the solution to these challenges lies with women.</p>
        <p>In Greater Englewood, where 60 percent of families are headed by single women, women are the ones holding families and community together. Women are leading with creativity and resilience - women like Iesha Trotter, a small business owner teaching other young women to be entrepreneurs while supporting her family.</p>
        <p>An entrepreneur her entire life, Iesha started Brown Sugar Balloon Design at just 19 years old. “I wanted to bring gift-giving to Englewood,” says Iesha.
        But Iesha ran into obstacles growing her business without a small business loan - she struggled to qualify due to lack of credit history. </p> 
        <p>CFW grantee Accion Chicago matched Iesha with a loan to establish credit, and a second loan to help grow her business.  “Financing is one of the things that can hit a small business,” says Iesha. “Because the Accion process was fairly easy and fast, it gave me a starting foundation to build my business credit.” </p>
        <p>Growing her business will help Iesha empower other women in her neighborhood to be entrepreneurs, leveraging Accion’s investment to help countless others. The addition of an Academy to her business model gives women “the option of creating a profitable business at a very low start-up cost,” with guidance from Iesha, giving them the tools to support themselves and their families.</p>
        <p>Accion is part of a group of ten grantee organizations convened by Chicago Foundation for Women, working to put 60 women in Englewood on the path to economic security, earning at least $40,000 a year, with benefits. Each takes a different approach to women’s financial security, and together, they form the Englewood Women’s Initiative.</p>
        <p>Underlying the Englewood Women’s Initiative is the understanding that job training is one step on a woman’s path to economic security; unstable housing, domestic violence, incarceration, or poor credit can derail her journey.</p>
        <p>Through EWI, women have access to a network of services and support. Chicago Women in Trades and Jane Addams Resource Corporation prepare women for careers in the trades. Demoiselle2Femme connects young women with mentoring to keep them on track. Family Rescue offers emergency housing, counseling, and legal support for survivors of domestic violence. Metropolitan Family Services provides job placement and financial literacy programs. Teamwork Englewood works with women re-entering the workforce to prepare them for their first job. Kennedy King College's Dawson Technical Institute prepares women to compete in the construction trades and utility industries with comprehensive training that leads to apprenticeships and other opportunities. Lawyers Committee for Better Housing connects renters with legal services and emergency funds to combat housing insecurity. Through the All Chicago Making Homelessness History Emergency Fund, women can get immediate assistance with basic home items, rent, child care and transportation. Women’s Business Development Center and Accion Chicago work with women business owners and entrepreneurs.</p>
        <div class="quote">
            <h3>Through EWI, Accion has invested $13,000 in women entrepreneurs in Englewood like Iesha.</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Every woman’s journey is different. EWI meets women where they are and works within the realities of women’s lives, referring women between services and collaborating to ensure their needs are met.</p>
        <p>Judith Scott of Metropolitan Family Services often refers clients to Family Rescue for support dealing with domestic violence. Jacqueline Ward coordinates the Mobile Unit at Family Rescue and says screening for warning signs of domestic violence helps reach women who otherwise might not seek help. “There is a stigma,” around domestic violence, she says. “Most people feel shame, guilt, or embarrassment, so most people won’t come in on their own. But if people are seeking other services and the option is there, they may feel safer checking that box. I’m glad that it’s there on our intake.”</p>
        <p>Through EWI, each partner has the opportunity to deepen their presence in Englewood, reach new clients, learn from each other, and develop new strategies. When Metropolitan Family Services identified a need for math education for women interested in the trades, Chicago Women in Trades worked with them to offer new classes. </p>
        <p>“I think that the women that have taken advantage, that have sought out the resources that we offer, have done really well,” Judith says. “They love that there’s an opportunity focused just for women,” she adds.  “I think the opportunities are endless.” </p>
        <p>The intensive collaboration is paying off. In the second year, EWI partners nearly doubled the number of enrolled women and increased retention, according to an independent evaluation by Loyola University’s Center for Urban Research and Learning. EWI women report that the programs better prepared them to apply for a better job and to plan for their family’s future. </p>
        <p>“I’m so proud to be a part of this initiative,” says Jacqueline. “There are wonderful people here, there are wonderful roots here. This has always been a vibrant place and for it be restored with hope and resources, I’m just really grateful.”</p>

           reproductive health and access coalition
        </h1>
        <p>In Illinois, the Reproductive Health and Access Coalition went to work to protect reproductive choice.</p>
        <p>The Reproductive Health and Access Coalition is comprised of health care providers, maternal and child health advocates, domestic violence service providers, youth and legal advocates. Uniting them is a “shared belief that reproductive rights are human rights,” says Brigid Leahy, Director of Government Relations for Planned Parenthood Illinois, a coalition member.</p>
        <p>Chicago Foundation for Women participates in and supports members of the Reproductive Health and Access Coalition as part of our mission to improve women’s access to health services and information. CFW has invested more than $1.9 million in coalition members throughout its decade of organizing, including Planned Parenthood of Illinois, ACLU of Illinois, Illinois Caucus for Adolescent Health (ICAH) and Mujeres Latinas en Accion (Mujeres).</p>
        <p>“We very quickly realized that with the court shifting there were a lot of things at risk that became urgent,” says Brigid.</p>
        <div class="quote">
            <h3>We had nothing in our state laws that recognized reproductive rights as fundamental rights.</h3>
        <h4>Brigid Leahy</h4>
        </div>
        <p>“Although courts had blocked many of these dangerous provisions restricting abortion care that had been enacted over the years, these restrictions were at risk of returning if the Supreme Court were to overturn -- or even chip away -- at Roe v. Wade,” says Ameri Klafeta, the director of the Women's and Reproductive Rights Project of the ACLU of Illinois. “At a time when <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2019/07/state-policy-trends-mid-year-2019-states-race-ban-or-protect-abortion">so many states</a> are enacting harsh bans aimed at blocking all access to abortion care, Illinois has come together to confront this trend.”</p> 
        <p>The Reproductive Health Act (RHA) championed by the Coalition repealed the <a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/illinois/2005/chapter53/1928.html">Illinois Abortion Law of 1975</a>, removing anti-choice language and criminal penalties for providing abortion care from state law, affirmed abortion care as health care and established a fundamental right to reproductive health.</p>
        <p>To pass the RHA, the coalition conducted statewide public outreach and education, culminating in a day of action at the state capitol.</p>
        <p>CFW grantee Mujeres Latinas en Accion, which provides domestic violence and sexual assault services and empowers Latina women as advocates, brought together Mujeres-trained community organizers and promotoras (health educators) and Planned Parenthood of Illinois for a postcard campaign supporting the RHA and community conversations about reproductive health and choice. “Creating that open dialogue helped,” says Monica Paulson, Advocacy Manager at Mujeres. “There were people who initially didn’t want to support the bill but then in the end decided that it should be up to everyone to decide for themselves.” Many of them went on to advocate for the bill in Springfield.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, CFW grantee ICAH worked to create a more inclusive conversation, emphasizing the inclusion of youth and trans voices in converations about abortion access. “Young people need to be at the table all of the time,” says Alyssa Vera Ramos, Arts Justice Organizer and Artistic Director at ICAH.</p>
        <p>Deborah, 16, traveled with ICAH to meet with legislators and advocate for the RHA. “Why shouldn’t youth be part of something just as much as adults?” Deborah asks.  “What is there to lose by having youth voices present? You lose nothing but you can gain so much from our perspective.”</p>
        <p>The Reproductive Health Act was signed into law by Governor J.B. Pritzker on June 12, 2019.</p>
        <p>“All of the members of the coalition, everybody had a role to play,” says Brigid. “We all have our strengths."</p>
            <div class="quote">
                <h3>It wasn’t one organization that accomplished the goal, it was everybody doing a little piece of the work that passed the bill and got it signed.</h3>
                <h4>Brigid Leahy</h4>
            </div>
        <p>“Every phone call, every legislator visit, every social media post came together to make the final victory possible,” adds Ameri. “Because of the shared commitment of so many -- each contributing in their own way, we have established reproductive health care as a fundamental right and cleaned up many of the antiquated requirements in Illinois law. Everyone who worked on this bill should be proud of their role in this effort.”</p>

        <h1>Willie's Warriors Leadership Initiative</h1>
        <p>“I want to build some more Addie Wyatts, some more Willie Barrows. I opened my house up to all of the powerful women in the movement ,” the Reverend Willie Taplin Barrow <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/3/12/civil-rights-activist-willie-barrow-dies-at-90.html">told the Chicago Sun-Times</a>. “That’s how I learned. We have to teach this generation.”</p>
        <p>Rev. Barrow was a minister, civil rights activist, co-founder of Operation PUSH, and mentor committed to educating the next generation of women leaders. Following her death in 2015, her values live on at Chicago Foundation for Women through the Willie Taplin Barrow Fund for Black Women’s Leadership.</p>
        <p>“Willie believed that women had every right and every ability to perform at the highest level,” says Dr. Calvin Morris, a close friend who organized alongside Rev. Barrow. “She was particularly concerned that women and girls of color would lack the confidence in themselves and their possibilities.”</p>
        <p>The Fund supports the Willie's Warriors Leadership Initiative, a leadership development program focused on elevating the leadership of Black women across the Chicago region through CFW’s Women’s Leadership Development Initiative (WLDI). In Fiscal Year 2019, the WLDI trained approximately 308 women leaders and their staff from over 40 nonprofit agencies on topics ranging from fundraising and board governance, to how to understand and advocate for responsible state and local budgets. Willie’s Warriors graduated two cohorts, totaling 29 women.</p>
        <p>“There are a lot of great women leaders who don’t necessarily perceive themselves that way because they don’t have the title, or haven’t done a lot of networking, because they’ve been doing the work,” says Dr. Pier Camille Rogers, Director of the Axelson Center for Nonprofit Management and Professor of Nonprofit Management at North Park University and member of the Willie’s Warriors Advisory Board.</p>
        <p>“We have a system that is not supportive of Black women’s style of leadership,” says Advisory Board member Claudette Baker, a nonprofit and philanthropic consultant.</p>
        <p>Through a series of half-day sessions and a co-created curriculum, as well as personalized one-on-one coaching, Warriors deepen their understanding of their leadership style and how to sustain themselves, and develop the tools and skills to build strategic alliances and change systems in pursuit of equity and justice.</p>
        <p>“It is about strengthening the leadership, and helping to share resources and information and connect women with each other,” Pier adds.</p>
        <p>Andrea Clark Horton and Tiffany McDowell were both drawn to Willie’s Warriors for its unique focus on mid-career development for Black women.</p>
        <p>“None of the other programs I had checked focused specifically on Black women and our issues, so that was exciting to me,” says Andrea, a Staff Chaplain for Women’s Health at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and a member of the inaugural cohort of Willie’s Warriors.</p>
        <p>“I had set a personal and professional goal to connect with more Black women leaders,” says Tiffany, Director of the Equity Institute at the YWCA Evanston/North Shore and co-founder of the Chicagoland Equity Network. “I was excited to see that CFW made the space for that to happen.”</p>
        <p>Graduating two cohorts in 2019, Willie’s Warriors is building a network of Black women leaders from across diverse sectors and backgrounds spanning education, health care, tenant rights, queer media, and government. </p>
        <p>“The friendships that formed - these really powerful connections with women across these different sectors - it’s one of the things that drew me to it,” Andrea adds. “It has been my colleagues in the program from whom I have drawn a lot of leadership lessons.”</p>
        <p>Warriors have the opportunity to learn from each other, as well as experts and activists like Aspen Institute Ascend Fellow and Family Story co-director Mia Birdsong and Black Youth Project 100 founder and author Charlene Carruthers.</p>
        <p>“The examples we saw were so powerful,” Tiffany adds.</p>
        <p>For Tiffany and Andrea, Willie’s Warriors offered valuable space to deepen their understanding of their personal leadership style and strengths. The time, space and support “to be able to figure out myself and how within this culture of Black women’s leadership, how I specifically function and how I can add to a team,” has helped Andrea feel more confident in her work.</p>
        <p>“It’s really thinking about who you are, what is your purpose and how can you use that purpose to lead others,” says Tiffany. “It’s not teaching you to be someone you’re not - it’s getting you closer to who you are and what you value.”</p>

        <h1>The South Side Giving Circle</h1>
        <p>“We want to offer the South Side a new narrative about what community can be and how we can leverage our collective resources, ideas and power to invest in the success of Black women and girls,” says Nicole Robinson, one of the co-founders of the South Side Giving Circle of Chicago Foundation for Women.</p>
        <p>One of three location-based community-led Giving Circles at CFW, the South Side Giving Circle brings together women who live and work on Chicago’s South Side and south suburbs to pool and mobilize philanthropic resources to invest in the economic, social and political power of Black women and girls in metropolitan Chicago.</p> 
        <p>“The South Side Giving Circle is an opportunity to elevate the strong history of philanthropy in Chicago’s African American community and demonstrate our collective impact,” co-founding member Jessyca Dudley said. “There’s a perception that we are trying to disrupt – that African Americans do not care about their own communities, that we are not willing to do the work to shape our communities.”</p>
        <p>After the Circle’s launch in March 2018, membership quickly grew from the original seven founding members to over fifty by the end of fiscal year 2019.</p>
        <div class="quote">
            <h3>We come from all walks of life. But the values that we all share is that we are passionate about the success of Black women and girls and helping them reach their full potential.</h3>
            <h4>Nicole Robinson</h4>
        </div>
        <p>The South Side Giving Circle made its first grants, totaling $33,000, to five women of color-led organizations: Assata's Daughters, organizing young Black people in Chicago through political education, leadership development and mentorship; Polished Pebbles, a mentoring program focused on healthy communication skills; Sisters Network - Chicago Chapter, providing Black women with information and resources on breast cancer; Violets in Bloom mentoring program; and Girls Like Me Project, Inc., a mentoring organization focused on empowering young Black girls through media literacy and digital storytelling.</p>
        <p>“Over the past few years, there has been a trend in philanthropy of supporting men and boys of color and less attention given to Black women and girls,” says Jessyca. “We wanted to be able to enter a conversation about why that is.” This attention towards equity and inclusion for Black women and girls and the organizations that serve them extended to how the Giving Circle approached grantmaking.</p>
        <p>“We wanted to make the process accessible to everyone,” says Jessyca. “We have an opportunity, particularly because it’s a group of women getting together with a focus on enabling organizations that serve women and girls, to think differently about how we are engaging in grantmaking.”</p>
        <p>For emerging organizations like Girls Like Me Project, the Circle’s open, accessible approach made all the difference. “When I went to apply, I saw that it was a grant application that was a little intimidating and just out of the scope of what we had the capacity to do,” says founder and executive director La’Keisha Renee Gray-Sewell. “We don’t have an accountant, we were not, at the time, a 501(c)3. So I started it but didn’t finish it and said OK, we won’t be able to do this.”</p>
        <p>When Eli Marsh, CFW’s Philanthropic Education Officer who coordinates the Giving Councils and Circles, reached out to La’Keisha about her unfinished application, La’Keisha shared her concerns. “The Giving Circle understood that, and they wanted it to be open and less cumbersome, so they restructured the application,” said La’Keisha. “I can’t even stress how much of a difference it made.”</p>
        <p>This was the first time La’Keisha has ever worked with a group of Black women funders.</p>
        <div class="quote">
            <h3>It’s just a different perspective - we knew that this would just bring a different heart to philanthropy.</h3>
            <h4>La’Keisha Renee Gray-Sewell</h4>
        </div>
        <p>The grant from the South Side Giving Circle supported the D.I.V.A.S. (Digitally Innovative Voices of Advocacy Sisters) in the City summer program, a six-week group-mentoring program which uses digital storytelling as a tool of connectivity and leadership. Girls learn the tools to push back against negative media to “reclaim their own narrative, and take charge of telling their own story from their perspective,” says La’Keisha.</p>
        <p>The Giving Circle grant also provided Girls Like Me Project with the final push to become a 501(c)3. “That opens up so many doors,” says La’Keisha, including academic partnerships and research. With the support of the South Side Giving Circle, Girls Like Me Project will also be embarking on a new partnership with CAN TV, producing their own TV show. Says La’Keisha, “Instead of being consumers of media, they get to produce it.”</p>

        <h1>Young women's giving council</h1>
        <p>Made up of 40 women ranging in age from mid-20s to mid-30s, the Young Women’s Giving Council is “focusing on inspiring philanthropy in communities we often see as ‘nontraditional’” says Adriana. Originally from Ecuador, Adriana moved to Chicago about eight years ago. A philanthropic advisor at The Chicago Community Trust, she joined the Council to learn more about grantmaking while building a community of like-minded women.</p>
        <div class="quote">
            <h3>Whatever amount you have to give makes an impact because of the fact that we are all pooling our assets.</h3>
            <h4>Adriana Viteri</h4>
        </div>
        <p>“As one person you might think that it’s not a lot or enough, but when we all come together, a group of 40 women, sharing that experience, creating community, learning and pooling our resources, the impact grows.”</p>
        <p>Using their collective impact, the Council invests in young women and girls throughout the Chicago region.</p>
        <p>Since 2008, the Young Women’s Giving Council has made 29 grants, totaling over $136,000. In Fiscal Year 2019, the Council invested $16,500 in three local organizations, with a focus on “organizations that are led by people of color, led by youth, [and] really representative of the people that we serve and of the diversity of Chicago,” says Adriana.</p>
        <p>As part of that focus, the Council hosted conversations about integrating the intersection of race, class, and gender in grantmaking. “We all have to be extremely aware of our own privileges and biases, and leave that at the door and be really responsible as we engage with community members and other organizations that are seeking funding,” adds Adriana.</p>
        <p>FY19 grantees include Global Girls, a youth performing arts and arts education organization on the South Side of Chicago; Gyrls in the H.O.O.D. Foundation, which works to improve reproductive health outcomes for young women; and Brave Space Alliance, the first Black-led, trans-led LGBTQ center on the South Side.</p>
        <p>Brave Space Alliance, a “by-us, for-us” organization, provides affirming, culturally competent programming and services for 300 LGBTQ people of color on the city’s south and west sides.</p>
        <p>“It was really special to us that the Giving Council that particularly deals with young women wanted to talk with us,” says Stephanie Skora, Associate Executive Director of Brave Space Alliance.
            <div class="quote">
                <h3>There is a need for services that deal specifically with young women in our communities.</h3>
                <h4>Stephanie Skora</h4>
        </div>
        <p>The most recent grant from the Young Women’s Giving Council supports pop-up LGBTQ resource centers, offering transition advice, housing and financial assistance, career services and connections to legal advice in safe, accessible locations; community organizing to address factors related to vulnerability to HIV; and advocacy to close gaps in health care services and address pervasive violence against trans people.</p>
        <p>This broad range of services is in direct response to the needs of the community Brave Space Alliance serves. “When you’re a LGBTQ center specifically for Black and brown people, then you run into all the problems that Black and brown people face, and LGBTQ people face, and Black and brown LGBTQ people specifically,” says Stephanie.</p>
        <p>Brave Space Alliance’s approach to serving and organizing LGBTQ people of color embodies the Giving Council’s values of responsible and responsive community engagement. “When people tell us they want to be served in a particular way, we listen,” Stephanie adds.</p>

        <h1>Syrian community network</h1>
        <p>When Suzanne Akhras Sahloul got the call that a fire had destroyed Syrian Community Network’s office space, the founder and executive director and her staff “were in shock,” Suzanne says.</p>
        <p>The office “was small, but it was mighty in use,” serving over 800 people from across the Chicago region, including 230 refugee, asylee and immigrant families, with support services, health education, English workshops, and leading interfaith organizing and advocacy for refugee resettlement.</p>
        <p>Staff suddenly found themselves in a situation eerily similar to that of their clients. “At that moment, we felt displaced,” Suzanne says.</p>
        <p>The immediate concern was getting back to work, says Suzanne. Illinois has the second-largest concentration of Syrians in the United States, and Syrian Community Network clients still needed support building a life in a new country.</p>
        <p>A community sprang into action. GirlForward, a fellow CFW grantee working with girls displaced by conflict and persecution, provided emergency office space. Others stepped in to offer meals, long-term space, and financial support to rebuild.</p>
        <p>At Chicago Foundation for Women, three Donor-Advised Funds, the Evelyn Appell Lipkin Endowed Fund, the Nancy M. Goodman Fund, and the Fay Clayton Fund, pooled resources to contribute funds towards new computers and office space for the agency, which had previously received CFW funding for culturally-competent domestic violence education and prevention.</p>
        <p>“An obvious benefit of a <a href="https://www.cfw.org/donor-advised-fund/">Donor-Advised Fund</a> is the ability to be nimble in times of immediate need,” says Sam Goodman, who directs the Nancy M. Goodman Fund in memory of his late wife.  As the first female Senior Vice President of the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank, Nancy was a champion of women’s empowerment and recognized for her unfailing support of her colleagues, especially young women starting their careers.</p>
        <p>A Donor-Advised Fund allows an individual or family to establish a fund at CFW to direct investments to organizations aligning with CFW’s mission and values. CFW serves as an advisor, helping to identify opportunities for responsive philanthropy and evolving needs.</p>
        <p>“What CFW was doing was exactly what I wanted to do with my funds,” recalls Fay Clayton, who established her Donor-Advised Fund in the 1990s with the goal of long-term giving. She appreciates the special projects brought to her by CFW staff, opportunities to give that she might otherwise have been unaware of, and projects that come with the “CFW seal of approval.” When she heard about the fire, “my heart went out,” says Fay.
            <div class="quote">
                <h3>I always feel a little better if I can help someone and making that grant to the Syrian Community Network was a way to do that.</h3>
                <h4>Fay Clayton</h4>
            </div>
        <p>Donor-Advised Funds also offer a path to continue the giving legacy of a loved one. Evelyn Appell Lipkin and her daughter Laurel created the Evelyn Appell Lipkin Endowed Fund at CFW in 2015. Laurel now directs the funds towards causes that would resonate with her mother, a progressive activist, and daughter of immigrants who supported refugee organizations throughout her life, which made supporting Syrian Community Network an easy decision for Laurel.</p>
        <p>“Funds that came in right away helped us to get organized,” says Suzanne. Syrian Community Network was able to replace the computers and secure new space even while insurance claims were being handled.
            <div class="quote">
                <h3>We’re so grateful to CFW and everyone who came and stood with us at that moment. At the local level, people stepped up and stood with us. That gave us comfort and solace knowing that we have so many friends.</h3>

            <h1>a letter from the president</h1>
            <p>Growing up, I watched my mother struggle to keep food on the table, a roof over our heads. She found strength in the people around us, the women who encouraged her, and a community that wrapped around us as my mother went back to school to complete her education.</p>
            <p>I see myself in the faces and the stories of the women and girls we impact at Chicago Foundation for Women.</p>
            <p>I would bet you recognize pieces of your own family’s story in some aspect of CFW’s work. That is part of what makes CFW such a powerful community: giving rooted in the belief that the challenges facing women and girls affect all of us, and that each of us holds a piece of the solution; that by working together, we can build a healthy, safe and just Chicago region, for all of us.</p>
            <p>CFW is here to bring together our individual contributions and direct them to where they can make the greatest impact. To do that, we rely on the input, expertise, and partnership of  communities, coalition members and grantees working with us to make Chicago the best place in the country for women and girls.</p>
            <p>Effective, responsive grantmaking starts and ends with community voice. CFW is here to listen, to learn, and to put resources and expertise to work for women and girls. Over the past year, the impact of CFW’s deep partnership with community has taken a number of forms: passing new legislation in response to fears about the future of choice; creating vehicles for inspired women to reinvest in their communities; making strategic investments based on the latest research; or iterating new programs to best meet the needs of the community.</p>
            <p>We’ve seen, time and time again, that when the voices of women and girls are put front and center, and heard, there is no limit to what we can accomplish. This year, Chicago Foundation for Women made its largest-ever investments of more than $2.8 million in 117 organizations, impacting the lives of over 70,000 women, girls, trans, and gender nonconforming people in our region.</p>
            <p>This impact is only made possible with the support of our donors, the partnership of our vendors, the trust of grantees, and with the leadership of women and our allies across our region. Together, we are building a stronger, more equitable Chicago region. For women. For girls. For all of us.</p>
            <p>Thank you for being with us.</p>
            <p>Let’s get to work,</p>
